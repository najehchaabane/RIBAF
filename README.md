**Repository for code and data related to the research project:**  
**_Crypto Market Stress Testing: Inflation & Financial Risk Analysis_**

This project analyzes the resilience of major cryptocurrenciesâ€”Bitcoin and Ethereumâ€”against inflation expectations and financial stress. 
Using daily data from 2018 to 2023, it examines how these digital assets respond to global economic disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S.-China trade war, the Ukraine conflict, and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

## ðŸ“° Publication  
This project is based on the published research:  
**"On the Resilience of Cryptocurrencies: A Quantile-Frequency Analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum Reactions in Times of Inflation and Financial Instability"**  
Published in *Research in International Business and Finance*, Volume 70, June 2024  


## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data manipulation, statistical diagnostics
- **SQL**: Structured data extraction and transformation  
- **R (R Studio)**: Wavelet Coherence and Quantile Coherency analysis  
- **Time-Frequency Analysis**: For capturing dynamic relationships over time-frequency and across quantiles

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- **Bitcoin** tends to increase in value during turbulent periods due to investor reactions to rising inflation expectations.
- Bitcoinâ€™s role as a hedge weakens in bearish markets, especially during high financial stress.
- **Ethereum** exhibits a more context-sensitive relationship with inflation, with increased vulnerability to financial instability in bearish regimes.
- Wavelet Coherence and Quantile Coherency analyses provide complementary insights into the shifting dependency structures between crypto assets, inflation, and financial stress.
